# Code Tinkering

This  is my personal playground for experimenting with various coding techniques, concepts, and ideas. This repository serves as a space to test new technologies, build small projects, and explore creative solutions without the pressure of perfection. From web animations and algorithms to exploring libraries and frameworks, this is where I refine my skills and try out new things in a hands-on way.
