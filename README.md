# Code Tinkering

This is my personal playground for experimenting with various coding techniques, concepts, and ideas. This repository serves as a space to test new technologies, build small projects, and explore creative solutions without the pressure of perfection. From web animations and algorithms to exploring libraries and frameworks, this is where I refine my skills and try out new things in a hands-on way.

## Strategy

In this chapter, we'll discuss the overall approach and thinking behind each project. Before diving into the code, it's essential to have a clear plan and understand what you want to achieve. Here, you'll see how to define goals, prioritize tasks, and set the direction..

## Structure

The structure chapter explores how to organize the code and projects effectively. Proper structure is key to maintaining readable, scalable, and maintainable code. We will touch on folder setups, component separation, and how to architect projects for simplicity and growth.

This outlines the projects file organization:

```
project/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
│
├── projects/                  # Folder to house individual projects
│   ├── code-project-1/
│   │   ├── index.html         # Code project 1 HTML
│   │   ├── styles.css         # Code project 1 specific styles
│   │   ├── script.js          # Code project 1 specific JavaScript
│   ├── code-project-2/
│   │   ├── index.html         # Code project 2 HTML
│   │   ├── styles.css         # Code project 2 specific styles
│   │   ├── script.js          # Code project 2 specific JavaScript
│   └── [future-projects]/     # Add more projects here

│   ├── styles.css             # Base and global styles for main SPA
│
├── js/
│   ├── scripts.js             # General JavaScript for SPA (e.g., menu toggle, lazy loading)

└── images/

```

## Skeleton

The skeleton represents the foundational framework of the project. This chapter focuses on building the basic structure or "bare bones" of your application—like setting up HTML for a webpage, defining the core logic of a script, or establishing the first working model of an idea.

_<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>_

## Surface

In this chapter, we focus on the final layer—the surface. This is where the project takes shape visually or reaches its completed form. Whether it's styling a web app, adding UI components, or polishing user interaction, the surface is what the users will see and interact with.

In this section, I will outline the visual aspects of the projects, including the color palette and typography used across the coding projects.

### Palette

### Imagery

All images used in this project are either original creations or sourced from reputable platforms. If an image is not my own, proper credit is provided to the creator or source. Unauthorized use of any images is prohibited without permission.

## Testing

We performed continuous manual testing of our site while developing it.
Validation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is OK.

_<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>_

## Prerequisites & Deployment

The site was developed in VS Code/Gitpod, stored in GitHub as the local repository.
Github Pages was used to deploy the live website. The instructions to achieve this are below.
